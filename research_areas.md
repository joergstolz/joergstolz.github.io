### Secularization
Together with Pascal Tanner, I argue that one of the main causes of secularization is religious-secular competition.

[Stolz, J. and Tanner, P. 2017. 'Elements of a Theory of Religious-Secular Competition'. Política & Sociedade 36.](xxxx)

I have written overview articles on the state of secularization research: 

[Stolz, Jörg. 2020. Secularization theories in the 21st century: Ideas, evidence, problems. Presidential Address. Social Compass, 67(2), 282-308.](xxx)

An application of the religious-secular competition framework can be found in:



### Congregations
Inspired by the work of Mark Chaves, I have conduct National Congregation studies in Switzerland.

### Ethnicity
Together with Anaïd Lindemann, I have conducted work on islamophobia: 

[Stolz, J. 2006. 'Explaining islamophobia. A test of four Theories Based on the Case of a Swiss City'. Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Soziologie 31: 547-566.](xxx)

[Lindemann, A. and Stolz, J. 2014. 'Use of Islam in the Definition of Foreign Otherness in Switzerland: A Comparative Analysis of Media Discourses Between 1970-2004'. Islamophobia Studies Journal 2: 44-58.](xxx)

[Lindemann, A. and Stolz, J. 2020. 'Perceived discrimination among Muslims and its correlates. A comparative analysis'. Ethnic and Racial Studies 44: 173-194.](xxx)





### Social Games
One of my theoretical ideas, probably inspired by my teacher Niklas Luhmann, is that the concept of the "social game" may be used to construct a general theory of the social world. For now, the following publications are available:

[Stolz, J. 2016. 'The Theory of Social Games as a Metatheory for Mixed Methods (in preparation)'.](xxx)

[Stolz, J. and Lindemann, A. 2019. 'The Titanic Game : Introducing game heuristics to mixed methods research'. Journal of Mixed Methods Research: 1-23.](xxx)



### Rational Choice, analytical sociology, and religion
Being a student of Raymond Boudon, I have always been interested in explanatory sociology. Several of my publications concern rational choice approaches and analytical sociology:

[Stolz, J. 2006. 'Salvation Goods and Religious Markets: Integrating Rational Choice and Weberian Perspectives'. Social Compass 53: 13-32.](xxx)

[Stolz, J. 2008. 'Secularization theory and rational choice. An integration of micro- and macro-theories of secularization using the example of Switzerland' in Pollack, D. and Olson, D.V.A. (eds.) The Role of Religion in Modern Societies. New York: Routledge.](xxx)

[Stolz, J. 2018. 'Economics of religion on trial: How disestablishment did not lead to religious revival in the Swiss cantons of Geneva and Neuchâtel'. Journal of Contemporary Religion 33.](xxxx)

[Stolz, J. 2009. 'Explaining Religiosity: Towards a Unified Theoretical Model'. British Journal of Sociology 60: 345-376.](xxx)




### Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists
I have always been fascinated by evangelicals, pentecostals and fundamentalists. Some of my work can be found here: 

[Stolz, J. and Favre, O. 2005. 'The evangelical milieu. Defining criteria and reproduction across the generations'. Social Compass 52: 169-183.](xxx)

### Mixed Methods
I believe that the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods has much to offer. My methodological views on mixed methods can be found in these publications:


Together with various colleagues, I have also conducted three large scale mixed methods studies on religion in Switzerland. The main publications are: 

On religiosity in Switzerland: 

On Evangelicals in Switzerland:
