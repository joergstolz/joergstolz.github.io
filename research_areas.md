### Secularization
Secularization research is one of my main fields of interest. I argue that one of the main causes of secularization is religious-secular competition, engaging religion in a ["silent battle"](assets/2013_SilentBattle.pdf). Secularization happens as the offer of secular goods is increased, crowding out the religious offer both because of functional superiority and time constraints. See for example: 

[Stolz, J. 2009. 'Explaining Religiosity: Towards a Unified Theoretical Model'. British Journal of Sociology 60: 345-376.](assets/2009_ExplainingReligiosity.pdf)

[Stolz, J., Könemann, J., Schneuwly Purdie, M., Englberger, T. and Krüggeler, M. 2016. (Un)Believing in modern society. Religion, spirituality, and religious-secular competition. London: Routledge.](assets/2016_Un_Believing_in_modern_society._Religio.pdf)

Here's a recent overview article on the state of secularization research that has appeared in Social Compass: 

[Stolz, Jörg. 2020. Secularization theories in the 21st century: Ideas, evidence, problems. Presidential Address. Social Compass, 67(2), 282-308.](assets/2020_Secularization.pdf)

Not everybody agreed and an interesting discussion resulted with [François Gauthier](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0037768620917327?journalCode=scpa), [Tobias Müller](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0037768620917328), [Sarah Wilkins-Laflamme](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0037768620917330), and [David Voas](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0037768620917329):

David Voas has suggested in excellent publications that secularization takes the form of a "secular transition". In an article on Germany with Detlef Pollack and Nan Dirk de Graaf we have shown that the state can actually accelerate this transition:

[Stolz, J., Pollack, D. and De Graaf , N.D. 2020. 'Can the State accelerate the Secular Transitition? Secularization in East- and West Germany as a Natural Experiment'. European Sociological Review 36: 626-642.](assets/CanTheState.pdf)

In other publications, we have looked at the secular transition in  [France](assets/France.pdf) with Ferruccio Biolcati and Francesco Molteni. Recent results on Switzerland, from work with Jeremy Senn can be found [here](assets/generations.pdf). 


### Congregations
Inspired by the work of Mark Chaves, I have conducted a National Congregation studies in Switzerland together with Christophe Monnot. This research produces representative information on the local religious groups across all religions. Currently, the [second wave](https://wp.unil.ch/ncs2/) is underway. One of the interesting questions to be solved before doing such a study is how to actually [recognize a congregation](assets/2015_RecognizeCongregation21 copy.pdf).

This research has allowed us to shed light on [female religious leadership](assets/2019_FemaleLeadership.pdf), the relationship between [established and newcomer religions](assets/2015_EstablishedNewcomers.pdf), [diversity of diversity](assets/2014_DiversityOfDiversity.pdf), [political engagement](assets/2019_EstablishmentPolitics.pdf) of local religious groups in Switzerland. 

Apart from showing basic facts about religion in Switzerland, NCS data has also allowed us to speak to more general theoretical debates. Thus, we have been able to show that - contra rational choice expectations - disestablishment does not lead to religious vitality: 

[Stolz, J. and Chaves, M. 2017. 'Does Disestablishment Lead to Religious Vitality? The Case of Switzerland'. British Journal of Sociology 2: 412-435.](assets/2018_EstablishmentBJS.pdf)

With Christoph Monnot, we have edited a book on ["Congregations in Europe"](assets/2018_CongregationsEurope.pdf) where findings from various countries are assembled.


### Ethnicity
Together with Anaïd Lindemann, I have conducted work on islamophobia: 

[Stolz, J. 2006. 'Explaining islamophobia. A test of four Theories Based on the Case of a Swiss City'. Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Soziologie 31: 547-566.](xxx)

[Lindemann, A. and Stolz, J. 2014. 'Use of Islam in the Definition of Foreign Otherness in Switzerland: A Comparative Analysis of Media Discourses Between 1970-2004'. Islamophobia Studies Journal 2: 44-58.](xxx)

[Lindemann, A. and Stolz, J. 2018. 'The Muslim Unemployment Gap in Switzerland. The Importance of Ethno-Religious Penalties'. Social Inclusion 6: 2.](xxx)

[Lindemann, A. and Stolz, J. 2020. 'Perceived discrimination among Muslims and its correlates. A comparative analysis'. Ethnic and Racial Studies 44: 173-194.](xxx)





### Social Games
One of my theoretical ideas, probably inspired by my teacher Niklas Luhmann, is that the concept of the "social game" may be used to construct a general theory of the social world. For now, the following publications are available:

[Stolz, J. 2016. 'The Theory of Social Games as a Metatheory for Mixed Methods (in preparation)'.](xxx)

[Stolz, J. and Lindemann, A. 2019. 'The Titanic Game : Introducing game heuristics to mixed methods research'. Journal of Mixed Methods Research: 1-23.](xxx)



### Rational Choice, analytical sociology, and religion
Being a student of Raymond Boudon, I have always been interested in explanatory sociology. Several of my publications concern rational choice approaches and analytical sociology:

[Stolz, J. 2006. 'Salvation Goods and Religious Markets: Integrating Rational Choice and Weberian Perspectives'. Social Compass 53: 13-32.](xxx)

[Stolz, J. 2008. 'Secularization theory and rational choice. An integration of micro- and macro-theories of secularization using the example of Switzerland' in Pollack, D. and Olson, D.V.A. (eds.) The Role of Religion in Modern Societies. New York: Routledge.](xxx)

[Stolz, J. 2018. 'Economics of religion on trial: How disestablishment did not lead to religious revival in the Swiss cantons of Geneva and Neuchâtel'. Journal of Contemporary Religion 33.](xxxx)

[Stolz, J. 2009. 'Explaining Religiosity: Towards a Unified Theoretical Model'. British Journal of Sociology 60: 345-376.](xxx)




### Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists
I have always been fascinated by evangelicals, pentecostals and fundamentalists. Some of my work can be found here: 

[Stolz, J. and Favre, O. 2005. 'The evangelical milieu. Defining criteria and reproduction across the generations'. Social Compass 52: 169-183.](xxx)

[Stolz, Jörg and Olivier Favre. 2019. Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists. Describing and Explaining Growth and Decline in Switzerland 1970-2013. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 58(3):604-25.](xxx)

[Stolz, J. 2011. '"All Things Are Possible". Towards a Sociological Explanation of Pentecostal Miracles and Healings'. Sociology of Religion 72: 456-482.](xxx)

### Mixed Methods
I believe that the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods has much to offer. My methodological views on mixed methods can be found in these publications:


Together with various colleagues, I have  conducted three large scale mixed methods studies on religion in Switzerland. The main publications are:
