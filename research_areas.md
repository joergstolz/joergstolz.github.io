### Secularization
Together with Pascal Tanner, I argue that one of the main causes of secularization is religious-secular competition.

[Stolz, J. and Tanner, P. 2017. 'Elements of a Theory of Religious-Secular Competition'. Política & Sociedade 36.](xxxx)


I have written overview articles on the state of secularization research: 
[Stolz, Jörg. 2020. Secularization theories in the 21st century: Ideas, evidence, problems. Presidential Address. Social Compass, 67(2), 282-308.](xxx)

An application of the religious-secular competition framework can be found in:


### Congregations


### Ethnicity
Together with Anaïd Lindemann, I have conducted work on islamophobia: 


### Social Games

### Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists
[Stolz, Jörg and Olivier Favre. 2019. Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists. Describing and Explaining Growth and Decline in Switzerland 1970-2013. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 58(3):604-25.](xxx)

### Mixed Methods

Together with various colleagues, I have conducted three large scale mixed methods studies on religion in Switzerland. The main publications are: 

On religiosity in Switzerland: 

On Evangelicals in Switzerland: 

On secularists in Switzerland:
