### Secularization
Together with Pascal Tanner, I argue that one of the main causes of secularization is religious-secular competition.

[Stolz, J. and Tanner, P. 2017. 'Elements of a Theory of Religious-Secular Competition'. Política & Sociedade 36.](xxxx)


I have written overview articles on the state of secularization research: 
[Stolz, Jörg. 2020. Secularization theories in the 21st century: Ideas, evidence, problems. Presidential Address. Social Compass, 67(2), 282-308.](xxx)

An application of the religious-secular competition framework can be found in:



### Congregations
Inspired by the work of Mark Chaves, I have conduct National Congregation studies in Switzerland. 


### Ethnicity
Together with Anaïd Lindemann, I have conducted work on islamophobia: 



### Social Games
One of my theoretical ideas, probably inspired by my teacher Niklas Luhmann, is that the concept of the "social game" may be used to construct a general theory of the social world. For now, the following publications are available:



### Rational Choice, analytical sociology, and religion
Being a student of Raymond Boudon, I have always been interested in explanatory sociology. Several of my publications concern rational choice approaches and analytical sociology:

Stolz, J. 2008. 'Secularization theory and rational choice. An integration of micro- and macro-theories of secularization using the example of Switzerland' in Pollack, D. and Olson, D.V.A. (eds.) The Role of Religion in Modern Societies. New York: Routledge.

### Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists
I have always been fascinated by evangelicals, pentecostals and fundamentalists. Some of my work can be found here:

### Mixed Methods
I believe that the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods has much to offer. My methodological views on mixed methods can be found in these publications:


Together with various colleagues, I have also conducted three large scale mixed methods studies on religion in Switzerland. The main publications are: 

On religiosity in Switzerland: 

On Evangelicals in Switzerland:
