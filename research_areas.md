### Secularization
Together with Pascal Tanner, I argue that one of the main causes of secularization is religious-secular competition.


Again, together with Pascal Tanner, I have written overview articles on the state of secularization research

An application of the religious-secular competition framework can be found in:


### Congregations


### Ethnicity


### Social Games


### Evangelicals, Pentecostals, Fundamentalists


### Mixed Methods
