---


Jörg Stolz is professor of sociology of religion at the University of Lausanne. 
He combines a theoretical interest with both quantitative and qualitative empirical 
research. Theoretically, he works on a general theory of social games and a theory 
of religious-secular competition. Substantively, he has conducted research on 
evangelicalism, the explanation of secularization and resacralization, comparative research 
on congregations in different religions, islamophobia, and secular and atheist beliefs. 
Jörg Stolz is the past president of the International Society for the Sociology of 
Religion (ISSR). His work has appeared in journals such as the European Sociological 
Review, the British Journal of Sociology, or the Journal for the Scientific Study of
Religion. He is the first author of « (Un)Believing in Modern Society. Religion, 
Spirituality, and Religious-Secular Competition. » (Routledge) and has co-edited 
the book « Congregations in Europe » (Springer, with Christophe Monnot).
