### Sociology of religion
My BA courses on the sociology of religion give an overview of the discipline from an analytical point of view. A textbook is 
in planning.

### MA course Mixed Methods
My MA courses on mixed methods take place at UNIL, but I also regularly give a 2-day course on the subject at GESIS, Mannheim.


### Mixed Methods and the Titanic Datasets
Together with Ana√Ød Lindemann, I have written three articles showing how to 
use the Titanic datasets for the teaching of mixed methods: 

Lindemann, A. and Stolz, J. 2021. 'Using the Titanic datasets to teach Mixed Methods Data Analysis'. Methodology 17: 231-249.

Stolz, J. and Lindemann, A. 2019. 'The Titanic Game : Introducing game heuristics to mixed methods research'. Journal of Mixed Methods Research: 1-23.

[Stolz, J., Lindemann, A. and Antonietti, J.-P. 2018. 'Sociological Explanation and mixed methods: the example of the Titanic'. Quality and Quantity 53: 1623-1643.](assets/TitanicExplain.pdf)
