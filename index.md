I am a sociologist working on religion, culture, ethnicity, and social games.

As a full professor of the sociology of religion at the University of Lausanne, I teach BA and MA courses in the sociology of religion as well as courses on quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods.

Currently, I am the director of the institute of the social sciences of religion and - alas - member of many other committees.

I am a fan of R as well as of jazz & improvisational theatre.

The goal of this website is to give an easy access to my work (often in collaboration with colleagues) and to permit downloading texts, material, and code.
