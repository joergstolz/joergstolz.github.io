Welcome to my website. 

I am a sociologist working on religion, culture, ethnicity, and social games. 

I am a full professor of the sociology of religion at the University of Lausanne where I teach BA and MA courses
in the sociology of religion as well as courses on quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods.

I hope you find something that interests you here - if you want to contact me, you're welcome to send me an email.
